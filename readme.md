A basic worpress theme boilerplate for builing, but not limmited to, corporate websites. It utilizes [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependancy management, [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mix) to compiling assets with webpack, and [TGM Plugin Activation](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/) for installing required plugins within the wordpress admin.  

#### Note
I recoment forking this repo to customize it to your liking.  

#### NPM
This theme uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependancy management.
```console
$ cd your/theme/directory
$ npm install // to initialize and install the dependancies.
```

#### Laravel Mix
This theme uses [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mix) to compiling assets with webpack. The content of the /src directory will be compiled to the /public directory. (You must run npm install for mix to work.)
```console
$ cd your/theme/directory
$ npm run dev // Run all Mix tasks.
```
```console
$ cd your/theme/directory
$ npm run production // Run all Mix tasks and minify output.
```
```console
$ cd your/theme/directory
$ npm run watch // Continue running in your terminal and watch all relevant files for changes.
```

#### Service worker
This theme uses a [Google Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) service worker to leverage browser caching

#### Functions.php
The functions.php loads a va79-theme-class.php file packed with all kinds of nice trickery:
- Clean up the header and footer.
- Loading header, footer, ie8 and ie9 css files. 
- Loading app.js and html5shiv.js
- Adds four widget areas for the footer.
- etc... View the source code its pretty self explanatory.

#### Todo
- Testing the theme for v1.0 tag.
